/*
    NOTE: cache.route() method returns us with a middleware 
    IF we directly return cache.route({name:key}) , userId is set to undefined , because
    this cache.route() middleware if passed directly runs whenever our Express router mounts
    and at that time auth middleware didnt ran .
    Now, in the above way , we return a middleware which then calls and return the cache.router({name:key})
    SO, now this middleware will run after auth middleware ensuring it doesnt runs when 
    Express router mounts and run only on *Request* and that too after auth middleware thus populating user
    in request;
